# ProjectOne: Notes of the Neighborhood :notes::city_sunrise:

## What is Notes of the Neighborhood?
Notes of the Neighborhood is a platform where users can discover new songs and artists based on where they are geographically located in real time.  It is a way to connect users to their community; ultimately helping residents, tourists, and transplants to connect to where they are through the music of that area.

## How does NotN work?
NotN works by using two APIs: IP Location and Spotify.  IP Location captures a user's location that is then communicated to Spotify's API. 
A user is then able to login to their Spotify account directly on NotN for an easy user experience.  They are then able to share the city's playlist or save it.

## Who uses NotN?
Music is a universal language so this is an app that anyone can tune into.

## What is NotN's goal?
NotN goal is to bring new music to users from where they currently are to ultimately connect them to the culture that has been established there.  Thus, bringing the user closer to understanding and experiencing it.

## How can you benefit from using NotN?
One can benefit from using NotN by not only discovering new artists, but ultimately broadening one's horizon to the world that's our their by discovering the music it produces.
